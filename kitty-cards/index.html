        This is a turn-based game: each player fills the board with cards. The
        cup's color determines the awarded points.
      </p>
      <p>To win, you need to have the highest points on the board.</p>

      <p>You start the game with two cards.</p>
      <p>
        On your turn, you can either <b>play</b> a card or <b>draw</b> a card
        from the draw deck.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play a card, choose the card to place on the board and select a cell
        to move the card to.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Placing a card on a cup of the same color = 2x value of that card.
        </li>
        <li>
          Placing a colored card on a blank teacup = 1x value on the card.
        </li>
        <li>
          Placing a colored card on a colored cup of the wrong color = 0 points
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
